- 👋 Hi, I’m @shugyoza
- 👀 I am a self-taught web developer. As you could see in my LinkedIn, I was an independent non-litigation lawyer in Indonesia with 17 (seventeen) years of experience in drafting legal instruments, also 2 (two) master of laws and a bachelor of laws, all from the best university in Indonesia. I am well trained to read references, think logically and analytically, also in brainstorming creative approaches to resolve problems, and map every possible scenario to anticipate and avoid future possible problems, in order to produce good legal instruments with minimum assumptions and potential flaws, just like what a coder must do to produce a good application. I made this leap because coding is fun!
- 🌱 I have worked with: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node-JS, React-JS, D3-JS, Pug, Express JS, API, and more to come!
