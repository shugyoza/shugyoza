- 👋 Hi, I’m Stephen
- 👀 A lawyer turned self-taught web developer. I made the leap because coding is fun! Are you hiring? Let's talk! I am well trained to read references, think logically & analytically, also in brainstorming creative approaches to resolve problems & map worst case scenarios to anticipate, like what a coder does to produce a good app, in order to produce good legal instruments with less assumptions and flaws.
- 🌱 I have worked with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, React, Express, D3, and MongoDB and will create more. I'm learning Postgresql, Pug, JQuery, SASS, Bootstrap and Redux. More to come! Hopefully.
- 💞️ Looking for a role as junior software engineer /developer, or intern, anywhere! Always strive to be better. If you have any suggestion or lead, let me know, and thanks!
