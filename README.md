- 👋 Hi, I’m Stephen
- 👀 A lawyer turned self-taught web developer. I made the leap because coding is fun! I read references, think logically & analytically. I also brainstorm creative approaches to resolve problems & map worst case scenarios to anticipate to produce a good app, in order to produce good legal instruments with less assumptions and flaws.
- 🌱 I have been working mainly with JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, Express, HTML, CSS, Angular, Angular Material, and MongoDB. I am familiar with Pug.js, React, D3, Sass, and Bootstrap. Learned a bit about Postgresql, JQuery, and Redux on the surface level, and would love to learn more.
- 💞️ I would love to connect with fellow coders.
