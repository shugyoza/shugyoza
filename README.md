- 👋 Hi, I’m Stephen
- 👀 A lawyer turned self-taught web developer. I made the leap because coding is fun! I read references, think logically & analytically. I also brainstorm creative approaches to resolve problems & map worst case scenarios to anticipate to produce a good app, in order to produce good legal instruments with less assumptions and flaws.
- 🌱 I have worked with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, React, Express, D3, and MongoDB and will create more. I'm learning Postgresql, Pug, JQuery, SASS, Bootstrap and Redux. More to come! Hopefully.
- 💞️ I would love to connect with fellow coders.
